## Tasks

1. [ ] layers
2. [ ] foundation
3. [ ] sdk
4. [ ] emulator
5. [ ] primitives
6. [ ] pipeline
7. [ ] answer

## Decisions

- setup: scope widened by the architect: beyond what a client application looks like, the spike
  builds the UI primitives spike-ai-pipeline's capstone needs and proves the layers stay clean at
  scale, live over a backend; it doesn't exercise the capstone's backend. GitHub Pages stays with
  spike-html-hosting.
- setup: the evidence is the ten items in `context/README.md`, "The evidence".
- setup: quality at every layer, judged as a finished product. STANDARDS.md carries the design
  bar; each layer's browser tier captures screenshots per state and profile; the foundation,
  primitives, and pipeline tasks put them in their session briefs, and the architect's acceptance
  is the design review.
- setup: three layer repositories, spike-html-apps-foundation, -components, and -sdk, releasing
  `@jaimestill/spike-html-apps-<layer>` from v0.1.0, copied from spike-html-packages' tags with
  provenance; not directories, since the capstone may depend only on published versions. The
  components peer the foundation at its current minor.
- setup: a primitive goes to components when it takes its data as its own properties with no
  domain type; the wiring stays in the app.
- setup: the Go serving half is proven in the spike's own `sdk` package, on go-web-sdk v0.15.2
  and go-core v0.10.0, not in go-web-service, which the spike never writes.
- setup: the backend is a minimal emulator, one Go binary from go-web-sdk-template
  template/v0.13.0 with all state in memory and four domains (documents, runs, conversations,
  search); no Postgres, Azurite, compose, outbox, JWT, or integration tier. Rejected: the
  capstone's compose stack, as premature engineering for a client spike.
- setup: live sync over NATS over WebSocket, with nats-server embedded in the emulator
  (JetStream, a temporary store directory for go-messaging's file-storage stream) and published
  through go-messaging's nats provider. SSE stays the fallback if embedding proves costly.
- setup: one static NATS token from the emulator's config, handed out by the SDK's token
  provider; real auth is a recorded gap.
- setup: the event-sequence interface resumes by the JetStream stream sequence as an opaque
  cursor. The NATS-over-WebSocket adapter is an sdk subpath with @nats-io/nats-core and
  @nats-io/jetstream as optional peers; its live cases run in the root against the emulator, and
  the sdk repository tests the interface with a fake.
- setup: the chat stream is a scripted Open Responses stream over HTTP; folding it into items
  lives in the pipeline app's domain tier. The chat thread's item property is a structural subset
  of Open Responses 2026-04-24 items.
- setup: eight new components (chat thread, composer, upload dropzone, stage timeline, event log,
  search results, artifact viewer for text, JSON, and Markdown, document list) beside the status
  badge, entry, and pagination; no embedding-space panel, toast, or image viewer.
- setup: theming ports spike-html-design v0.7.0's profiles, preferences module, and theme menu,
  the menu's sheet moved to a .css file.
- setup: shortcuts are single keys only, for critical operations, never chords: `/` search, `?`
  help, `t` theme menu, Escape cancel or close; Enter sends and Shift+Enter breaks a line in the
  composer. The app owns the key table; no component binds a key.
- setup: herald is a frame of reference only; no herald configuration is measured or ported.
- setup: the pipeline app is a demonstration; the capstone's UI lives in spike-ai-pipeline's root.
- setup: kind code; `mise run check` = shellcheck, grown by the layers task to
  spike-html-conventions' check plus gofmt, go vet, go test -race, and golangci-lint.
  `mise run currency` over the mise pins, extended to package dependencies and go.mod. No gate,
  no CI on the root.
- setup: spike-ai-pipeline is pinned at main 315ccec, after client-core merged, and
  spike-ai-pipeline-client at v0.1.0.
- setup: the capstone's gates were corrected in the coordinator: it waits on spike-model-engines,
  spike-model-layout, spike-model-gateway, spike-ai-pipeline's own tasks, and spike-html-apps, not
  on either experiment's intake.

## Pending edits

- v1.client: `NewClient`, proven in spike-html-apps' `sdk` package, moves to go-web-service's
  `sdk/` and then go-web-sdk; the answer task fills in the result.
- v1.middleware: the CORS middleware measured for an external client; the answer task fills in
  what it needed.
- standards-lab `context/ai-strategy.md`, the capstone bullet: the capstone's UI builds on the
  spike-html-apps layer tags and the SDK's event-sequence interface; the answer task names the
  tags.
- standards-lab `context/roadmap.toml`, the spike-ai-pipeline summary: the same clause.
